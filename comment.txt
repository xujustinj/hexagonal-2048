"Hello, I love this version of 2048. I am currently studying in 
year 1 of Computer Science, and I'm wondering if I can add some 
comment or suggestions for the game because I'm currently trying 
to learn p5 and I'm very good at playing 2048. 

The game looks more legit than other similar versions of hexagonal 
2048 on the search results XD, though it would probably be a bit 
less empty if there's some other things as well (like an undo 
button!). It would also be neat if the game can save the user's 
progress and highscore if the user leaves the webpage or refresh 
it."
