*I made this file to make a pull request*

"Dear xujustinj,

Hello, I love this version of 2048. I am currently studying in year 1 of Computer Science. 
Although I'm still a beginner in javascript related languages, I wonder if I can add some 
comment or suggestions for the game because I'm currently trying to learn p5 and I'm very 
good at playing 2048. 

The game looks more legit than other similar versions of hexagonal 2048 on the search 
results XD, though it would probably be a bit less empty if there's some other things as 
well (like an undo button!), or even some parts of the documentation in the README file. 
It would also be neat if the game can save the user's progress and highscore if the user 
leaves the webpage or refresh it.

Thanks for reading, leave a reply to the pull request if you would like to have a 
contributor. Have a nice day!

Yours faithfully, 
Lok To Cheng (Jasper)
